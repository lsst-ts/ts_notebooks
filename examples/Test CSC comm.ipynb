    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, if you are planning on running this notebook is to copy it to your home folder. This will prevent multiple users from running the same notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, before you can proceed to communicate with CSCs, make sure you loadded the correct notebook environment. In the upper right-hand side of the notebook there must be a `LSST` written before the empty circle, just bellow the notebook tabs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to make sure the opensplice setup file is loaded when the notebook server starts. To do that open a terminal, edit the file `~/notebooks/.user_setups` with your preferred text editor (both vi and emacs are available) and add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "source $OSPL_HOME/release.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to the bottom of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that you are ready to go. Restart the notebook kernel (go to Kernel > Restart kernel) and you are all set. \n",

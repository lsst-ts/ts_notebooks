These jupyter notebooks provide examples of single Aux-Tel processes.  
These processes can be very simple (e.g.-taking a single science exposure) 
or somewhat complex (e.g.-Taking a focus sequence).  

If some of notebooks are deemed relatively complete and useful, they might be copied to a place
  for more general use.
